## 1.0 Overview

This section should give a basic overview of the project and the organisation behind it. An overview could include:

### 1.1 About your organisation
– A brief company background and history.
### 1.2     What problem are you trying to solve?
– Why is the project needed?
 ### 1.3    High-level project scope
 – Is it a redesign of a few pages, a complete website overhaul, or a brand new website?
 ### 1.4     Target market
  – An overview of who this website is targeted at. This could also be it’s own section in the document.

##  2.0  Team
A list of the decision makers involved in the project. It is useful to include job titles/project roles, and email addresses.

The project lead should both be highlighted here.

For example:

    Rachel Adams – CEO – racheladams@acme.co
    John Smith – Marketing Manager – johnsmith@acme.co
    Sarah Jones – Web Content Manager – sarahjones@acme.co – Project Lead
##  3.0  Goals
Briefly describe the goals of the project. This will give developers an idea of what you are trying to achieve, which will enable them to suggest the most appropriate solutions.

For example:

    Monthly sales enquiries up by 10% within 3 months
    Decrease bounce rate by 10% by 1st July
    Increase newsletter signups by 23% by December
    1k new Twitter followers within a year

Goals should be SMART, that is:

    Specific
    Measurable
    Assignable
    Realistic
    Time-related
##   4.0 Phases
If this project is part of a bigger project, or there will be further phases following this project, it is useful to list these to give an indication of where this project fits into the bigger picture.

For example:

    Phase 1 – Basic marketing website – Current project
    Phase 2 – Add e-commerce
    Phase 3 – CRM integration

##   5.0 Content

Content structure, or Information Architecture (IA), is comprised of various parts and will depend on the complexity and size of your website content.

###  5.1 Site map

This is usually provided as a diagram which shows the ‘tree’ type, hierarchical structure of the website pages. It can also include which ‘page template’ (see below) to use for each page and content type.

There are excellent tools available for creating website sitemaps. We love Gloomaps.
###  5.2 Content types

A website can contain many distinct types of content. At it’s most basic, there will usually be posts and pages. A page is timeless content, e.g. ‘About us’, whereas a post is chronological, e.g. a news or blog post.

Some other common examples of content types are:

    People
    Products
    Testimonials

Content type data

For each content type, the data associated with that content type should be listed. For example, if there was a ‘Person’ content type they might require the following data:

    First name
    Last name
    Position
    Bio
    Email address
    Phone number

###  5.3 Taxonomies

A taxonomy is a scheme of classification for your website content. You can set site-wide taxonomies to be used across all content types, or you can have taxonomies that are specific to certain content types.

For example, if you had a recipe website you might want a taxonomy of ‘meals’ where the taxonomy terms would be ‘breakfast’, ‘lunch’, ‘dinner’, ‘snacks’, ‘dessert’, etc. You could also have a taxonomy of ‘cuisine’, with terms such as ‘indian’, ‘british’, ‘french’, etc.

On a blog, the most common two taxonomies are ‘Categories’ and ‘Tags’.

There are two main types of taxonomy:

    Hierarchical – e.g. ‘Categories’
    Non-hierarchical – e.g. ‘Tags’

Another example might be an ‘Industry’ taxonomy, which you could assign to your ‘Blog’, ‘Client’, ‘Case study’, and ‘Service’ content types.
###  5.4 Page templates

A page template is a specific layout of information. For example, your ‘Home’ page will probably look different to your ‘Contact’ page.

Some examples of common page templates are below:

    Home
    Blog post
    ‘Our team’
    News archive – lists all the sites news posts in reverse chronological order
    Contact – may have a map and a form

If you have designs (wireframes or mockups) for these page templates please include them here.

##  6.0  Design

The content of this section will depend on whether a design already exists, or whether creating a design is part of the scope of work.
Design exists already

If design work has already been completed, then it can be referenced here.

There are many ways to provide design assets, for example:

    PDFs (annotated if possible)
    Invision project links
    Flat image files
    PSD files
    Sketch files

It is important to provide a style guide and/or annotations for information such as:

### 6.1     colours
### 6.2     typography rules
### 6.3     hover states
### 6.4     animations
### 6.5     grid systems
### 6.6     spacing

Responsive designs

Today’s websites are viewed on a wide range of devices and screen sizes. It is important to consider how your site will look, especially on small screens such as smartphones.

Mobile designs (and possibly tablet sizes) should be provided along with the usual desktop designs.
Design as part of the project scope

If the visual design is part of the project you will need to give guidance on the constraints and desired stylistic direction.

For example, if your organisation has brand guidelines that should be adhered to, they should be included here.

Each designer will have their own process, but it can help to provide:

    Brand guidelines – such as colours, fonts, logos, other graphic
    Print material – brochures, business cards, etc.
    Analysis of competition – what you like and don’t like about their websites
    Examples, and reasons for, websites that you like and dislike


##  7.0  Functionality

Functionality is how your site actually works. This could be anything about specific parts of the website that need additional explanation.

For example, if you have a signup page, what fields are required? What happens to an entry on a contact form?

Many sites require integrations with third-party APIs. If this is the case then these integrations should be outlined here in terms of how they will work and any additional information that is needed. A good example of an integration is showing a feed of latest Tweets on your site.

Here are some examples of functionality you may want to mention, depending on your project.

    e-Commerce functionality such as payment gateways
    SSL – is this required and how it should be implemented
    Multi-lingual capabilities
    User roles and capabilities – more than 1 type of user role where users can have different permission etc.
    Analytics and tracking
    Specific functionality around search
    Performance requirements
